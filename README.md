# 🚗 Waze User Churn Analysis

## 📌 Overview
The Waze data team is analyzing **user churn behavior** to understand why some users **stop using the app**. The goal is to identify **key engagement patterns, driving behaviors, and app usage trends** to improve **retention** and develop **targeted solutions** for at-risk users.

## 📊 Project Status
- ✅ **Data analysis completed**, revealing behavioral differences between churned and retained users.
- 🔎 **Identified high-usage drivers** as a unique group requiring further investigation.
- 📈 **Insights suggest potential improvements** in Waze features to better serve long-distance drivers.
- 🚀 **Next phase**: Implementing strategies to enhance user retention.

## 🔍 Key Insights
1️⃣ **High-usage drivers require further investigation** – These users drive **significantly more** than others but are more likely to churn. Their behavior suggests **unique navigation needs**.  
2️⃣ **Retained users engage more consistently over time** – They use Waze **regularly**, spread across more days, indicating strong long-term app value.  
3️⃣ **Long-distance drivers may need specialized app features** – Their churn suggests Waze may **lack key functionalities** for extended trips, such as **fuel tracking, rest stops, and advanced trip planning**.  

## 🎯 Objective
- **Understand churn patterns** by analyzing user behavior and engagement metrics.  
- **Identify key factors influencing churn** among long-distance and high-usage drivers.  
- **Develop strategies** to enhance user retention and engagement.  
- **Recommend app improvements** to cater to different driver segments.  

## 📊 Results
- 📌 Churned users **drive 240% more km/day** than retained users, suggesting **they have different usage needs**.  
- 📌 Retained users **show consistent engagement**, using Waze across more days per month.  
- 📌 High-mileage drivers **churn at a higher rate**, indicating that **Waze may lack critical features** for long-distance travel.  
- 📌 No significant difference in churn rate between **Android and iPhone users**.  
- 📌 **Personalized engagement & feature improvements** could help **reduce churn & enhance retention**.  

## 🚀 Next Steps
✔ **Develop new app features** tailored for long-distance drivers (fuel tracking, rest stop planning, route optimization).  
✔ **Implement AI-driven churn prediction** to identify users at risk of leaving and offer personalized retention strategies.  
✔ **Enhance engagement tactics**, such as **gamification, push notifications, and loyalty rewards** to improve app stickiness.  
✔ **Conduct targeted user surveys** to gather insights on **specific pain points** of long-distance and high-usage drivers.  
✔ **Monitor competitors’ strategies** to ensure Waze remains a **leading choice for navigation & trip planning**.

## 📌 Conclusion
The **Waze User Churn Analysis** provided valuable insights into the **driving behaviors and engagement patterns** that influence user retention. The study revealed that **high-mileage drivers churn at a higher rate**, indicating **potential feature gaps** that need to be addressed. **Retained users engage more consistently over time**, suggesting that **effective retention strategies** can be implemented to prolong app usage.

To mitigate churn and improve user satisfaction, Waze should focus on **personalized engagement strategies, AI-driven churn prediction, and enhanced app features for long-distance drivers**. By addressing these key areas, Waze can **increase user retention, strengthen engagement, and remain a top navigation choice for all driver segments**.
